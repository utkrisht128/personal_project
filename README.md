# Valentine's Day Proposal Website

A cute, single-page website to ask your Valentine out! 💕

## Features
- **Mobile First**: Looks great on phones.
- **Interactive Proposal**: "No" button runs away!
- **Valentine Week**: 7 days of cards that unlock on specific dates (Feb 7 - Feb 13).
- **Customizable**: Easy to change messages/images.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the site.
2. Click "Yes" to see the celebration and the Valentine Week grid.

## Customization
Open `script.js` in any text editor. At the top, you will see a `valentinesWeek` list.
You can change the `message` for each day there.

### Testing Date Logic
By default, cards only unlock on their specific date (e.g., Rose Day unlocks on Feb 7).
To test properly *before* the date:
1. Open `script.js`.
2. Change `const DEBUG_MODE = false;` to `const DEBUG_MODE = true;`.
3. Refresh the page. All cards will be unlocked!
**Remember to set it back to `false` before sending it to her!**

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
1. Upload these files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `assets/`) to a new GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Select the `main` branch and click **Save**.
4. GitHub will give you a link (e.g., `yourname.github.io/repo`). Send that link to your Valentine! 💌
